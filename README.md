# JavaScript Memory Game

This is just sample Memory Game with JavaScript.  
I created this for my learning.  

[View Demo](https://chocolat5.github.io/javascript-memory-game/)

The changes are as follows

* Card images
* Keep images visible after cards matched
* When all cards matched, create "Play Again" button. Click this button to reset the game (remove class "match", reset count numbers etc)

Images from [IconStore](https://iconstore.co)
Use "[Monster Icons](https://iconstore.co/icons/monster-icons/)"
